# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to take existing code and refactor it so that it follows accessability standards and ensures the site is optimized for search engines. My motivation in completing this project was to test my knowledge on what I had learned while building out a webpage using HTML and CSS. I built this project so I could learn how to take existing code and refactor it to meet certain standards and use my newly aquired skills. I improved the code for long-term sustainability using semantic HTML elements, elements that follow a logical structure and accessible alt attributes. I ensured that the heading attributes fall in sequential order, and the title elements contain consise, descriptive titles. During this challenge I learned how to consolidate CSS selectors and properties which makes the CSS more efficient overall.
